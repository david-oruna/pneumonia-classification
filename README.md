# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Classification

The goal of this project is to classify pediatric X-ray images to determine whether a child has pneumonia or not. Students will work with a dataset of labeled images and will be able to choose between applying Transfer Learning techniques with pre-trained models or proposing and training their own convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The performance of the model will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify pneumonia cases.

## Dataset
This project uses [Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/pediatric-pneumonia-chest-xray) containing 5,856 pediatric X-ray images, which are labeled as pneumonia or normal. Obtaining and standardizing pediatric X-rays is a more complicated process compared to adults, due to the difficulty of working with children in a clinical setting. A dark environment, with strange machines and personnel behind windows, can create discomfort in children.

In addition, children's physiology is different from that of adults, which presents an additional challenge in medical image classification algorithms. Most available datasets tend to focus on adults, so this dataset provides a valuable opportunity to develop models capable of handling these particularities.
